# 5-Story Building Dynamic Analysis (MATLAB)

This MATLAB project was completed in 2016 as a coursework exercise for the **Structural Dynamics** class.  
It performs a complete **modal analysis** of a 5-story shear building and evaluates its dynamic response under different loading conditions.

## Features

- Modal analysis of a 5-story building
- Calculation of natural frequencies, periods, and mode shapes
- Step and harmonic force responses
- Maximum displacements, story drifts, base shear, and overturning moments
- Graphical visualization of mode shapes, displacements, and drifts

## Files

- `5DOF_SDA.m` — Main MATLAB script implementing all calculations
- `elcentro.txt` — El-Centro earthquake acceleration record used in the analysis

## Course Information

- **Course:** Structural Dynamics
- **Professor:** Omid Bahar
- **Student:** Amir Yarmohamadi
